## 🚀 **Immediate Next Steps**

### **1. Get Your API Key (2 minutes)**
1. Visit [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. Sign up for free account
3. Generate API key (activates in 10-15 minutes)

### **2. Run Locally (1 command)**
```bash
# Copy environment template and add your API key
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API key, then:
source venv/bin/activate && python app.py
```
**→ Visit http://localhost:8080**

### **3. Test with Docker (2 commands)**
```bash
docker build -t weather-dashboard:v1 .
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_key weather-dashboard:v1
```

    server web02 172.20.0.12:8080 check
```

**Testing Commands:**
```bash
# Test round-robin load balancing
for i in {1..6}; do curl -s http://localhost/health | jq '.timestamp'; done

# Test application functionality
curl http://localhost/api/weather/London
```
