   - Type "New York" in the search box
   - Show autocomplete suggestions appearing
   - Click on "New York, NY, US"

2. **Current Weather Display**
   - Point out current temperature, weather description
   - Highlight weather statistics (humidity, wind, pressure, visibility)
   - Show sunrise/sunset times

3. **5-Day Forecast**
   - Scroll down to show forecast cards
   - Explain daily highs/lows and weather conditions

### Part 2: Interactive Features (30 seconds)

4. **Quick Access Cities**
   - Click on "Tokyo" pill to instantly get Tokyo weather
   - Show smooth loading animation

5. **Favorites System**
   - Click the heart icon to add Tokyo to favorites
   - Show favorites section appearing
   - Demonstrate removing from favorites

6. **Responsive Design**
   - Resize browser window to show mobile responsiveness
   - Show all features work perfectly on different screen sizes

### Part 3: Technical Excellence (30 seconds)

7. **Error Handling**
   - Search for an invalid city like "XYZ123"
   - Show graceful error message
   - Demonstrate retry functionality

8. **Performance Features**
   - Mention parallel API calls for current weather and forecast
   - Show local storage persistence (refresh page, favorites remain)
   - Point out smooth animations and transitions

### Conclusion (20 seconds)
"This application demonstrates all assignment requirements: real external API usage, meaningful user interactions like search and favorites, comprehensive error handling, and is ready for containerization and load-balanced deployment. The complete source code, Docker configuration, and deployment instructions are included in the README."
